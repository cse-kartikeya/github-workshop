            <h2>Introduction</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a
            computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.<br>
            Depending on your requirement and project, it is important to choose the right data structure for your
            project.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Linear Data Structure</li>
            <p>In linear data structures, the elements are arranged in sequence one after the other. Since elements are
                arranged in particular order, they are easy to implement.
                However, when the complexity of the program increases, the linear data structures might not be the best
                choice because of operational complexities.</p>
            <li>Non Linear Data Structure</li>
            <p>Unlike linear data structures, elements in non-linear data structures are not in any sequence. Instead
                they are arranged in a hierarchical manner where one element will be connected to one or more elements.

                An operating system (OS) is a collection of software that manages computer hardware resources and
                provides common services for computer programs. The operating system is a vital component of the
                system software in a computer system. This tutorial will take you through step by step approach
                while learning Operating System concepts.

            <p>An Operating System (OS) is an interface between a computer user and computer hardware. An operating
                system is a software which performs all the basic tasks like file management, memory management,
                process management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk
                drives and printers.
                Some popular Operating Systems include Linux Operating System, Windows Operating System, VMS,
                OS/400, AIX, z/OS, etc.</p>

        <p>Data communications refers to the transmission of this digital data between two or more computers
            and a computer network or data network is a telecommunications network that allows computers to
            exchange data. The physical connection between networked computing devices is established using
            either cable media or wireless media. The best-known computer network is the Internet.</p>

            <p>A system of interconnected computers and computerized peripherals such as printers is called
                computer network. This interconnection among computers facilitates information sharing among
                them. Computers may connect to each other by either wired or wireless media.

            <li>Network Engineering</li>
            <p>Networking engineering is a complicated task, which involves software, firmware, chip level
                engineering, hardware, and electric pulses. To ease network engineering, the whole
                networking concept is divided into multiple layers.</p>
            <li>Internet</li>
            <p>A network of networks is called an internetwork, or simply the internet. It is the largest
                network in existence on this planet.The internet hugely connects all WANs and it can have
                connection to LANs and Home networks. Internet uses TCP/IP protocol suite and uses IP as its
                addressing protocol. Present day, Internet is widely implemented using IPv4. Because of
                shortage of address spaces, it is gradually migrating from IPv4 to IPv6.</p>
